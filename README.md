# Challenge Project: Frida Kahlo Retrospective

This project is a Codacedemy challenge project for Python lists. 

The project description:

> You’ve been hired to work on a retrospective of Frida Kahlo’s work at a major museum. Your job is to put together the audio tour, but in order to do that, you need to create a list of each painting featured in the exhibit, the date it was painted, and its spot in the tour.
> 
> Use your knowledge of Python lists to create a master list of each painting, its date, and its audio tour ID.
>
> You will be completing this project on your own computer, using a Jupyter notebook. Follow the steps below to set yourself up for success!

## Requirements
* Python installed (e.g. through Anaconda or Miniconda)
* Jupyter Notebook installed
* Basic navigation knowledge in a command line interface (CLI). 
    * I'm using Git Bash on Windows, which is a Bash shell.
    * On Mac or Linux, the in-built terminals are already Bash shells.

## Getting started
1. In the terminal, navigate to the directory containing the project and type

        jupyter notebook

    This should open a browser tab with the Jupyter file navigator interface
2. Click on **frida_project.ipynb** in the browser tab. This will open your Jupyter notebook
3. Follow the steps in the Jupyter Notebook. If you get stuck, you can look at **frida_solution.ipynb** for the answer.
